<p class="m-b-5">As our site is accessible so we need responsive ui, to support and adapt with unlimited number of viewing condition device dimention and device pixel density. It need to be very smooth and functionable. We need to think about our end user and their disabilites. Our end user may be have:- </p>
<dl>
    <dd>Different screen size</dd>
    <dt>Plan:- We need to make our website responsive, to support unlimited number of viewing condition, device dimention and pixel density</dt>
    <dd>Slow Internet Connection & Older technology</dd>
    <dt>Plan:- We need to start with in the very simple way and then add feature to it. In that way our site should be support to any device & slower connection. </dt>

    <dd>Audience of your product</dd>
    <dt>Above issues are very common, you need to take them very carefully. But whenever you plan your website you need to think about who will be your end user ? Then you should design your product / website. </dt>

<h2>Team Building and Personal development</h2>
<p>When you confirm you audience, and made a plan for your product/website now you need to build your team. People who understand accessibility and make someone incharge to ensure everything is working well. Tech every one how the assestive technology work. How to navigate and use the product/website with assestive technology. It will help them to understand the coding/desinging process in a deep lavel and it probably can create an empathy.</p>

<h2>Test and toolset</h2>
<p>Make sure you test your product without just assume the product is accessible. There are huge tools and community to test your product/website. It is better to test web with real disable people rather than the tool. But in developement process you can add automated test for accessibility and can add it to continuos intregration. </p>
