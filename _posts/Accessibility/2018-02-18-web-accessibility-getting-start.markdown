## What is Accessibility (A11Y) ?
<strong>Accouring to wikipedia:</strong> "Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people who experience disabilities. The concept of accessible design and practice of accessible development ensures both "direct access" (i.e. unassisted) and "indirect access" meaning compatibility with a person's assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers). Accessibility can be viewed as the "ability to access" and benefit from some system or entity." Mainly Accessibility is site content should be accessible by any one and functionality can be operate by any one. If you think your site is design nicely and content are clear. But here is something cause all user can't use same interface like pointer or touch screen and also all user does not have equal vision , hear and other ablility like you. Some are may be blind or partially blind, some of the user may be have hear problem, some of them are color blind, some of them have cognitive / brain problem. There are temporary disabilities, may be some one break their arms or finger on they are in very bright or dark inviroment And situational disabilities like someone in emergency situation when he/she can't think clearly. So When you design your web you must need to remember that every one will not see or fell your web as you do. And for this you need to extra carefull when you design and develop your website.
