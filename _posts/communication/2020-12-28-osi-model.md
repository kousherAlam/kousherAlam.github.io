### Layer 1: Physical Layer:
Received Sinal and Convert it to frame for the Data Link Layer.
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 2: Data Link Layer:
Data link layer embaded in computer network interface card. It perform two basic operation it access media using framing 
Logical Address
Physical Address : mac address assigned. 
CSMA: Career Sense Multiple Access. 
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 3: Network Layer:
Send DAta from one computer and other computer. Ip addressing is done here. It's assign sender and receiver an ip address. Routing is done here. 
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 4: Transport Layer:
It controls relaibility of data transform. port, secuence, 
Flow
Automatic Repeat Request 
TCP, UDP
TCP Does give Feedback While UDP does not give any feedback. 
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 5: Session Layer:
It helps setting up and keep the connection with network. It keep track which data packet belong to which file in a perticular connection. it help with Sessing management, authentication, and in authorization. 
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 6: Presentation Layer:
It received data from application layer. It's convert appliation data into binary format. In here computer uses data compression such as gzip. Before that data is encrypted. Translation / Compression / Encryption / Decription
<br/>
<br/>



### Layer 7: Application Layer:
Is used by network application, means computer application which use Network. Expample: google chrome. There are many protocol involve here, such as http, https, ftp, smtp, telnet etc..
