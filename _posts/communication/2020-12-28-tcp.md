description: OSI Model is the heart of the computer networking system, for a software engineer having understanding of OSI model is crutial.

## OSI Model 
OSI Stand For `Open System Interconnection`, it is a standard to communication two computer accross the network. It defines some standard layer from how bit will be transfer to the application. 
### The Problem OSI Model Solve
Suppose we want to transfer data between two computer across the internet, the installted hardware and software may be different in this two computer. So encoding and decoding of bits from receiving to showing it to user can be different. This can cause huge problem. To resolve the problem OSI Model is born.

### Layer 1: Physical Layer:
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 2: Data Link Layer:
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 3: Network Layer:
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 4: Transport Layer:
It controls relaibility of data transform. port, secuence, 
Flow
Automatic Repeat Request 
TCP, UDP
TCP Does give Feedback While UDP does not give any feedback. 
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 5: Session Layer:
It helps setting up and keep the connection with network. It keep track which data packet belong to which file in a perticular connection. it help with Sessing management, authentication, and in authorization. 
<br/>
<br/>


### Layer 6: Presentation Layer:
It received data from application layer. It's convert appliation data into binary format. In here computer uses data compression such as gzip. Before that data is encrypted. Translation / Compression / Encryption / Decription
<br/>
<br/>



### Layer 7: Application Layer:
Is used by network application, means computer application which use Network. Expample: google chrome. There are many protocol involve here, such as http, https, ftp, smtp, telnet etc..
