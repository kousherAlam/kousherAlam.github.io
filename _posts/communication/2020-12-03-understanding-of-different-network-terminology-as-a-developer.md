## Port [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)]
-----------
Logical construct that identify an process of an system. A port is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by a 16-bit unsigned number, known as the port number. A port number is always associated with an IP address of a host and the type of transport protocol used for communication. It completes the destination or origination network address of a message. Specific port numbers are reserved to identify specific services so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a running application.





## Sockets [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket]
------------
A network socket is a software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network. The structure and properties of a socket are defined by an application programming interface (API) for the networking architecture. Sockets are created only during the lifetime of a process of an application running in the node.





## IPC (Inter Process Communication) 
---------------------------------
It's the communication protocol between two processes. they used shared memory and also messaage passing system when try to communication.  




## RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)
-----------------------------
RPC is a protocol that allow us to communicate with different program located on different network, without knowing the network details. 

In RPC it use message based communication scheme, and messages are structured.
