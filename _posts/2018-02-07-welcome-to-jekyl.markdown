You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<div class='someting' id='other'>
  <header>
    <h1>Hi somehing i want to tell</h1>
  </header>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li><a href='#'>data</a></li>
      <li><a href='#'>data</a></li>
      <li><a href='#'>data</a></li>
      <li><a href='#'>data</a></li>
    </ul>
  </body>
  </footer>copyright &copy; google.com</footer>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
  let x = `hello world`;
  console.log(x);
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight css %}
.highlight{
    margin: 10px 0px;
    padding: 10px;
    background: #272822;
    overflow: auto;
}
{% endhighlight %}
